My name is Marko and I am interested in Data Science.
Following a course on courserea I've come to use GitHub. 
I will probbably use it for some of my data experiments and tests. 
This first one is inteded to be used with my graduation project but in the future I might do some data analysis regarding Google Play experiments which is related to my work and some other Psychology experiments which are a passion of mine. 
I hope to enroll in masters course related to Data Science next year.
